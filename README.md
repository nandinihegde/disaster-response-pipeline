## Description

This Project is part of the Udacity-Data Science Nanodegree Program in collaboration with Figure Eight.
The dataset contains pre-labelled tweets and messages from real-life disaster events. 
The goal of this project is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to categorize messages into 
respective genres on a real time basis.The project also demonstrates the NLP model using a flask web-app.

This project is divided in the following key sections:

1. Processing data, building an ETL pipeline to extract data from source, clean the data and save them in a SQLite database
2. Build a machine learning pipeline which can classify text message in various categories
3. Run a web app which can show model results in real time

## Getting Started

<a name="dependencies"></a>
### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, sklearn
* Natural Language Process Libraries: NLTK
* SQLlite Database Libraqries: SQLalchemy
* Model Loading and Saving Library: Pickle
* Web App and Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly

<a name="installation"></a>
### Installing
To clone the git repository:
```
git clone  git@github.com:nandinihegde/disaster-response-pipeline.git
```
<a name="execution"></a>
### Executing Program:
1. You can run the following commands in the project's directory to set up the database, train model and save the model.

    - To run ETL pipeline to clean data and store the processed data in the database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/disaster_response_db.db`
    - To run the ML pipeline that loads data from DB, trains classifier and saves the classifier as a pickle file
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/disaster_response_db.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

### Additional Material

In the **data** and **models** folder you can find two jupyter notebook that will help you understand how the model works step by step:
1. **ETL Preparation Notebook**: learn everything about the implemented ETL pipeline
2. **ML Pipeline Preparation Notebook**: look at the Machine Learning Pipeline developed with NLTK and Scikit-Learn

### Important Files
**app/templates/***: templates/html files for web app

**data/process_data.py**: Extract Train Load (ETL) pipeline used for data cleaning, feature extraction, and storing data in a SQLite database

**models/train_classifier.py**: A machine learning pipeline that loads data, trains a model, and saves the trained model as a .pkl file for later use

**run.py**: This file can be used to launch the Flask web app used to classify disaster messages
